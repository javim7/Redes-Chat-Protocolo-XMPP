### Methods used

Alumchat consists of a series of functionalities; these are all implemented as functions in the the `client.js`.

The four main functionalities the application has are the following:
- `register(username, password, email)`: creates a new account in the server.
- `login(username, password)`: logs in to an existing account.
- `logout()`: logs out from the account logged in.
- `deleteAccount()`: removes an account from the server.

Once a user is logged in, there are many more functionalities that the user can do inside the app, which include:
- `getContacts()`: retrieves a list of all the contacts in the Roster: retrieves JID, status, and status message. 
- `addContact(jid)`: adds a specified user to the roster. (Subscription will be 'both' until the other user accepts the request).
- `getContact(jid)`: retrieves all the contact information of a specified user in the roster.
- `handleContactRequest(fromJid, accept)`: accepts or rejects a friend request from a specified user.
- `directMessage(jid, message)`: sends a message of type 'chat' to a specified user.
- `chatMessage(groupName, message)`: sends a message of type 'groupchat' to a specified group.
- `createGroup(groupName)`: creates a new group with the configurations needed to be able to use it.
- `inviteToGroup(groupName, username)`: invites a specified user to a specified group already created.
- `join(groupJId)`: joins an existing group (has to be called every time you want to chat in a group).
- `handleGroupInvite(fromJid, accept)`: accepts or rejects an invitation from a specifed group.
- `changeStatus(show, status = "")`: changes the status and status message.
- `sendFile(jid, filePath)`: sends a file to a specified user. (The function uses the XEP-0363 protocol to achieve this.)
- `listenForStanzas()`: prints any incoming notifications the user may have.

As mentioned before, the `main.js` file is the responsible for controlling the client, so all these functions are in the `client.js`, but the main also has these functions, but they only call the client functions, which have all the logic in them. 

It is also important to mention, that in the `client.js` there are many more functions which weren't mentioned. These werent't mentioned because they are not part of the main functionalities, but they are important because they are all helper methods for at least one of the main functions.
